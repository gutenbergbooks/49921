<p>While it is generally understood that the three great musical countries
are Italy, Germany, and France, it must not be forgotten that
Poland revolutionized the music of the pianoforte, the most popular
and universal of all instruments. That small country looms up very big
indeed in the history of the piano. Paderewski, the greatest pianist of our
time, and one of the best composers (although his day as such has not yet
come), is a Pole, and so is the pianist who ranks next to him, Josef Hofmann.
Karl Tausig, in his day, was a piano giant; while three other
Poles are well known to all music-lovers of our time,&mdash;Moszkowski and
the Scharwenka brothers, all of them composers for the same instrument.</p>

<h3>CHOPIN, THE SOUL OF THE PIANO</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 253px;">

<img src="images/illus02a.jpg" width="253" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">FRÉDÉRIC CHOPIN</p>

<p class="caption">From a portrait made by Stattler, after
original by Ary Scheffer.</p>

</div>

<p>Greatest of all the Poles, however, is Frédéric François Chopin. While
his name is usually printed with the French accents, and the French are
inclined to claim him as their own because his father emigrated from
France to Poland, he himself was as thoroughly Polish in all his sympathies
as his mother, and there is reason to believe that his paternal
ancestors also came originally from Poland. Some of the traits that have
endeared his music to all players and listeners&mdash;its elegance, its charm,
its polished style&mdash;make it seem French; but the Poles also are noted for
these same qualities; and in other respects Chopin’s music is as thoroughly
and unmistakably Polish as it is an expression of his unique genius.</p>

<p>This is true particularly of his polonaises and his mazurkas. Polonaises
seem to have been played originally at the coronation of Polish
kings when the aristocrats were marching past the throne; while the
mazurkas were quaint old folk dances. In Chopin’s pieces the aristocratic
and the folk elements are artistically blended, and that is one of
their principal charms. Like Luther Burbank’s wonderful new fruits, they
unite the raciness of the soil with the qualities of his own creative genius.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 189px;">

<img src="images/illus02b.jpg" width="189" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE CHOPIN MONUMENT</p>

</div>

<p>Why does an audience invariably applaud a Chopin <i>valse</i> enthusiastically,
provided it is well played? Because the Chopin <i>valse</i> is both popular
and artistic. No one thinks of the ballroom while it is heard: it is enjoyed
because of its enchanting melody, its rhythmic swing, its elegance, and
its exquisite harmonic changes. Why are his <i>études</i> applauded with no
less fervor? Because, though modestly called studies, they are dazzling
displays of skill and at the same time lofty
flights of poetic fancy, astonishing in their
originality, like most of his works. “Preludes,”
he called more than two dozen of his
short pieces; but they are so many precious
stones, every facet polished by a master hand.</p>

<p>His splendid sonatas were for a long
time underrated, because he refused to cut
them according to traditional patterns; but in
these days of musical free thinking we laugh at
such objections
and applaud his
sonatas as much
as his short pieces.</p>

<p>While the public
loves Chopin
for the reasons
hinted at, experts
hold him in highest honor also because he
discovered the true language of the piano,
which all the composers who came after him
had to learn to speak. By his ingenious use
of the pedal to combine “scattered” tones
into chords he revealed an entirely new world
of ravishing tone colors of extraordinary richness
and variety. Quite new, too, were the
dainty ornamental notes that here and there
bedew his melodies like an iridescent spray.
He created not only a new style of playing,
but also pieces of new patterns, or forms;
whereas most of even the greatest masters had contented themselves
with accepted traditional forms and simply enlarging or improving them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">CHOPIN PLAYING IN THE SALON OF PRINCE RADZIWILL (1829)</p>

</div>

<p>When Paderewski plays a Chopin mazurka, he varies the pace incessantly,
with most enchanting, poetic effect. This is called “tempo
rubato.” It was used before Chopin, notably by opera singers; but it
was through him that it became the accepted mode of interpreting all
poetic music, not only for the piano, but for the orchestra. Thanks to
Chopin’s influence, combined with that of Wagner and Liszt, no good
pianist or orchestral conductor of our time performs a piece of music in
monotonous metronomic time, except in a ballroom.</p>

<h3>MENDELSSOHN’S MUSICAL SUNSHINE</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 246px;">

<img src="images/illus04a.jpg" width="246" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY
HOUSE IN HAMBURG</p>

<p class="caption">Moses Mendelssohn, the father of Felix,
was a banker. He added Bartholdy to
the family name.</p>

</div>

<p>When Mendelssohn’s parents called him Felix they chose the right
name for him; for Felix means happy, and throughout his life few things
occurred to cast on him shadows of dark clouds like those which occasioned
the gloomy moods of Chopin, Beethoven, Schumann, and Liszt.
While Chopin also had his happy moments, a vein of sadness twines
through most of his pieces. It is significant that of these pieces the
one most often heard is the funeral march from one of his sonatas; whereas
of Mendelssohn’s pieces the one most in vogue is the jubilant wedding
march from his music to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Evidently
there dwells in most souls a love of both the sad and the cheerful in art.</p>

<p>There was a time when Mendelssohn’s
popularity was second to that of no other
composer. His short piano pieces known
as “Songs without Words” in particular
enjoyed unbounded popularity, thanks to
their tunefulness, which all could appreciate.
The thing was overdone, and as in
all such cases the inevitable reaction came,
these pieces being looked on now as mere
sentimental trifles. Paderewski, however,
has shown that if played in the modern
way they appeal as much as ever to music
lovers. He has the audacity to use the
<i>tempo rubato</i>, which Mendelssohn would
have none of; but there is reason to think
he would like it as used by Paderewski.</p>

<h3>MENDELSSOHN’S SONGS AND
CHORAL WORKS</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 160px;">

<img src="images/illus04b.jpg" width="160" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY
MONUMENT, LEIPSIC</p>

</div>

<p>While the songs of Mendelssohn enjoyed
for a generation as wide popular favor as his “Songs without
Words,” it is not likely that they will ever recover their lost ground,&mdash;ground
which they lost because, though tuneful, most of them are
superficial. There is no doubt a good deal of “small talk” in many
of Mendelssohn’s works, and small talk has no
enduring value. But while the songs of this
master are now neglected, his choral works, “St.
Paul” and “Elijah,” still awe and thrill modern
audiences, because in them, as in the oratorios of
Handel and Bach, religious fervor is expressed
in terms of noble music.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 236px;">

<p class="caption">FELIX MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY</p>

<p class="caption">From a portrait painted by Horace Vernet. This
is considered an excellent likeness of the composer.
The face reflects his sunny disposition.</p>

</div>

<p>It is a curious and somewhat paradoxical fact
that, while Mendelssohn’s personal sympathies
were on the whole rather with the conservative
classicists in the matter of form than with the
modern progressives, by far the greatest of his
works, particularly for orchestra, are those in which
he heeds the modern craving for realism and program
music, as illustrated in his “Fingal’s Cave”
overture, the “Scotch” symphony, and the “Midsummer
Night’s Dream” music. The overture to
this is one of the marvels of music; for it is amazingly
original from every point of view, though written
by him when he was only seventeen years old.</p>

<p>It is commonly assumed that Italy is the land of melody; but Theodore
Thomas used to maintain, and rightly, that the prince of melodists
was the Austrian, Franz Schubert. Tunes flowed from his brain as
spontaneously as water flows from a gushing well. He slept with his
spectacles on, so as to lose no time when he jumped out of bed to jot down
the melodies that came to him like inspirations from above. While he read
a poem, the music suitable for it often sprang from his brain, Minerva-like.</p>

<h3>SCHUBERT, GREATEST OF MELODISTS</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 169px;">

<img src="images/illus06a.jpg" width="169" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE SCHUBERT MEMORIAL,
VIENNA</p>

</div>

<p>It is this spontaneity of Schubert’s melodies that explains their
vogue, their universal popularity.
Strange to say, during his life (which,
to be sure, was pathetically short) his
wonderful songs were, with a few
exceptions, neglected, partly because
with his melodies there were associated
harmonies and modulations which
to us are ravishing, but which to his
contemporaries were “music of the
future.” The shrill dissonance of the
child’s cry when he thinks the Erlking
is seizing him in the death-grip was
as revolutionary and as far ahead of
the times as anything Wagner or Liszt
ever wrote. It was Liszt, by the way,
who directed the world’s attention to
the marvels of Schubert’s songs by
playing them in his matchless way on
the piano. Seeing how they moved
audiences, the singers then took them
up, and more and more convinced
the world that among song writers
Schubert was indeed king.</p>

<p class="caption">SCHUBERT’S BIRTHPLACE, VIENNA</p>

<p class="caption">The composer was born here in 1797.</p>

</div>

<p>It is one of the strangest facts in musical history that the great
masters who came before Schubert&mdash;while some of them (Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven) wrote a considerable number of songs&mdash;reserved their best
inspirations for their operas, symphonies, and sonatas. Schubert was
the first who was willing to put his best into a “mere song,” and that
helps to explain his appeal to all music lovers.</p>

</div>

<h3>SCHUBERT’S INSTRUMENTAL PIECES</h3>

<p>While he put of his best into his songs, there was plenty of it left
for his instrumental pieces. Rubinstein considered his short pieces
for piano even more marvelous than his songs, and among his symphonies
there are two (the “Unfinished,” in two
movements, and the ninth) that are as popular
with high-class audiences as the best of Beethoven’s,
which they even surpass in richness and
novelty of orchestral coloring and in variety and
novelty of modulation, while their melodic charm
is as great as that of his songs.</p>

<h3>SCHUMANN, CHIEF OF ROMANTICISTS</h3>

<p>While Schubert belongs to the romantic
school, he did not follow all of its principal
methods. In so far as he wrote chiefly short
pieces and allowed them to crystallize into forms
of their own (the variety of form in his songs
is astonishing), he is a romanticist; but in writing
instrumental pieces he did not associate poetic
titles or stories with them. In this respect Schumann
went far beyond him in the direction of
realism and program music, and for this reason
he is considered the most thoroughly romantic of the German masters.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 189px;">

<img src="images/illus07a.jpg" width="189" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">ROBERT SCHUMANN</p>

<img src="images/illus07b.jpg" width="170" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE SCHUMANN MEMORIAL,
BONN</p>

</div>

<p>In his early period, in particular, he seldom wrote a piece without
suggesting in the title a poetic basis for it. It was his custom to issue
his pieces in groups, with a general title for the group, like “Papillons”
(Butterflies), “Kinderscenen,” “Faschingsschwank,” “Kreisleriana,”
and a special title for each piece in
the group, suggesting its message.</p>

<p>To many lovers of Schumann these early pieces are still the dearest.
He was more thoroughly romantic when he wrote them than he was in later
years, when he came too much under the influence of Mendelssohn and the
classical masters, and at the same time grew less original and spontaneous.</p>

<p>It is not difficult for those who have read the romantic and pathetic
story of his life to connect the waning of his originality with the gradual
coming on of the mental disease to which he finally succumbed. Fortunately
the bulk of his works, including four admirable symphonies and
some excellent chamber music,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> notably the glorious quintet for piano
and strings, was written before his creative power was weakened.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Chamber music is the term used for pieces played by a group (“ensemble”) of instrumentalists too small to be
called an orchestra. Most frequently these pieces are for a few players of string instruments (quartets, quintets, etc.),
with or without piano. Program music is music that seeks to depict or suggest a thunderstorm, the babbling of a brook,
or any incident, scene, or poetic fancy associated with it by the composer.</p>

</div>

<p>It has been said that Mendelssohn would
have made five pieces with the material Schumann
used for one. This highly concentrated
quality of his music makes it more difficult to
understand, and explains why his contemporaries
did not appreciate him as they did Mendelssohn.
It also helps to explain the better
“keeping qualities” of Schumann’s music.</p>

<p class="caption">ROBERT AND CLARA SCHUMANN</p>

</div>

<p>While Mendelssohn’s songs, for instance,
have, as just stated, virtually disappeared from
recital programs, Schumann’s are more popular
than ever, and seldom today is a program
printed without one or a group of them. The
best, by far, of his songs
are among the hundred
he wrote during the year
when he married Clara
Wieck, after a long contest
with her father for
the possession of her
heart, though it had belonged to him for years.
The popularity of Schumann’s songs is due largely
to their being the expression of this ardent love.
Women have not yet written immortal songs; but
they have inspired many of them.</p>

<h3>LISZT, THE MANY-SIDED</h3>

<p>Richard Wagner called Liszt “the greatest musician
of all the ages.” He certainly was the greatest
pianist of them all, unequaled to this day; but he was
very much more than that. In all departments of music,
except the opera and chamber music, he created
a new epoch or opened new and glorious vistas; and his influence on the
musicians of his time and those who came after him was as great as Wagner’s.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">

<img src="images/illus08.jpg" width="385" height="500" alt="" />

<p class="caption">LISZT PLAYING AT THE HOME OF MADAME MUNKACSY</p>

<p class="caption">This picture, by the artist Frédéric Régamey, represents one of the brilliant assemblages in the salon
of Madame Munkacsy, in Paris. In the picture are many portraits. Beside Liszt stands Madame Munkacsy,
next to her Gounod, and grouped in the front are Saint-Saëns, Portales, Daudet and other notables.
Munkacsy, the celebrated painter, stands at the back on the extreme left.</p>

</div>

<p>The strangest thing in Liszt’s extraordinary career is that when he was
at the height of his fame as a pianist, and fabulous sums were offered him for
recitals, he renounced his instrument, so far as concerts were concerned. For
charity he would play occasionally, and for his friends and his pupils; but
not for the paying public. This happened thirty-nine years before he died.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<img src="images/illus10b.jpg" width="300" height="197" alt="" />

<p class="caption">LISZT’S HOME IN WEIMAR</p>

<p class="caption">It was in this house that he
spent his latter years.</p>

</div>

<p>Various motives prompted this action, one of them being that he preferred
creative work. Thus it came about that the loss of his contemporaries
in not hearing him play was our gain in enabling us to hear his
songs, his piano pieces, his choral and orchestral compositions. Many
of these are still “music of the future”; but their day is dawning.</p>

<p>At piano recitals, in America as in Europe, no composer’s pieces are
now more favored than Liszt’s. Pianists
usually place them at the end of the program;
not only because they make a brilliant
close, but because they prevent the
audience from leaving before the end, as
few or none want to miss these pieces.</p>

<h3>THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF LISZT</h3>

<p class="caption">LISZT AT THE PIANO</p>

<p class="caption">From a photograph made late in life.</p>

</div>

<p>The reasons why the public is so enamoured
of Liszt are
not far to seek.
While Chopin is,
as Rubinstein
called him, “the
soul of the pianoforte,”
because
he makes it speak its own language as no
one had made it speak before, Liszt’s piano
music is no less idiomatic, and at the same time
it is even richer in color and more varied in
tonal power, or what musicians call “dynamic
effects.” Not satisfied with the piano as such,
Liszt converted it into a miniature orchestra,
enabling the pianist to thunder or to whisper in
tones not previously heard from that instrument.</p>

<p>Much of Liszt’s music, for both piano and
orchestra, is program music: it tells its story
in tones. In “St. Francis Walking on the
Waves” one actually hears the waters, as in
the orchestral “Mazeppa” one hears the galloping
of the wild steed
and the groans of
the man tied on its
back. The public
likes music with such
pictorial associations; but it would never have taken
to Liszt’s program music as it has were it not at the
same time good as music pure and simple,&mdash;interesting
melodically, rhythmically, and harmonically.</p>

<p>Musicians, as well as the public, admire in
Liszt’s orchestral works the same variety of new
colors that enrich his piano music. They honor
him for having created new forms of music in his
symphonic poems, differing from symphonies as
Wagner’s music-dramas differ from opera.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 146px;">

<img src="images/illus10c.jpg" width="146" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">LISZT MONUMENT, WEIMAR</p>

</div>

<p>What the public likes best of all in Liszt’s
works, however, is his Hungarian rhapsodies, in
which the gipsy songs of love and war and every
phase of life are “pianized” with marvelous art, one of the greatest
charms of which is that it is absolutely unfettered and unconventional,&mdash;a
real improvisation, like the playing of gipsies themselves.</p>

<h3>BRAHMS, THE CONSERVATIVE</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 165px;">

<img src="images/illus11b.jpg" width="165" height="300" alt="" />

<p class="caption">THE BRAHMS MEMORIAL,
VIENNA</p>

</div>

<p>Admirers of Liszt, and full-blooded Wagnerites, rarely care much
for Brahms; while, conversely, the Brahmites look somewhat haughtily
on those two composers, and all the other “progressives,” except Schumann,
who is exempted, not only because there is a certain affinity between
his music and that of their idol, but because he discovered Brahms,
proclaiming him the
“musical Messiah.”
Brahms himself once
signed a “protest” aimed
against the Wagner-Liszt
school; yet his
bark was worse than
his bite, for his works
here and there show
the influence of Wagner,
and he liked some
of Wagner’s operas.</p>

<p>Johannes Brahms
is the god of the conservatives.
He aimed,
half-consciously, to
carry on the traditions
of Beethoven, and he
had no use for modern
realism and program music. His symphonies&mdash;the most delightful
of which is the second&mdash;are marked simply numbers one, two, three,
and four; and for his piano pieces he has no poetic titles after the manner
of Schumann: they make their appeal by their own beauty, unadorned&mdash;and
they have won a large audience of admirers.</p>

<p>Some of his songs everybody likes. They are on most programs, and
are often redemanded. The music goes well with the
words, and they are usually written most effectively
for the voice, which makes the singers favor them
too. But it is in his chamber music&mdash;trios, quartets,
or sextets, for strings, with or without piano&mdash;that
Brahms’ genius is most convincing. In this
department he has composed many masterworks.</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that, while Brahms
is melodically less spontaneous than some of the
other masters, he excels most of them in the variety
and originality of his rhythms.</p>

<h2><i>Editorial</i></h2>

<p>A favorite phrase of ours has just come
home to us in an oddly altered form. Its
character has been completely reversed,
and yet its value remains much the same.
The phrase that we used referred to one
of the advantages offered by The Mentor
Association. We stated that The Mentor
gives the facts that people ought to know
and want to know about a subject, and we
pointed out that a reader of The Mentor
would find himself in a position to talk
intelligently about many subjects that he
had not understood before. Most people
like to talk about things that they have
come to know. We reckoned without one
thoughtful reader, however, for he has
come back at us with this: “I like The
Mentor and it helps me. The more I read
it the more I realize the value of having
knowledge ready at hand. But it does not
make me feel like talking <i>more</i> on various
subjects, rather like talking <i>less</i> and listening
more.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>And so our phrase, completely changed
in color, returns to us. We are satisfied&mdash;let
our reader be assured of that&mdash;for the
phrase is just as valuable in the form in
which it returns as in that in which we
sent it out. We congratulate our reader.
He is on the way to the greater benefits in
the field of knowledge. He wants to know
in order to <i>grow</i> rather than to <i>show</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>It is a great satisfaction to us to have
readers bring home a phrase, especially
when they amplify the idea themselves.
Some time ago we called attention to the
value of the odd moment, and we cited
the case of a French woman who had employed
so profitably her odd moments
that in the course of a few years she had
read during those moments an astonishing
number of standard works. This has
brought to mind several other striking
illustrations of industry in cultivating the
odd moment. Madame de Staël was a
keen minded woman, actively interested
in the public affairs of her time&mdash;and
withal a very cultivated woman. In the
midst of troublous social and political conditions
she was a vigorous, energetic
figure, and during all her activities she
managed to accumulate a fund of information
that was a source of amazement to
her friends. “How do you gather all this
knowledge?” she was once asked. “What
time do you find to read? You seem to us
to be busily engaged through all your
working hours.” “You forget my sedan
chair,” was Madame de Staël’s answer.
While being carried in her chair she had
as a companion a book or some bit of
profitable reading, with which she mentally
capitalized those brief intervals in
her busy day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">

</div>

<p>We have been informed that a very
eminent American preacher read no less
than one hundred books in the course of
three years, at his dining table. During
that period of time he had always a book
beside him at the table, and, whenever delays
occurred, he would advance a few
pages. The inference from this is that the
divine was either a very fast reader, or
that his table service was very slow; but
in either case the results accomplished are
an impressive demonstration of the value
of the odd moment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>Suppose, now, that the essential information
from lengthy books should be
put into an article of not over 2,500 words,
by a competent authority, and this material
be put before you in a simple, readable
manner, accompanied by illustrations.
Would not that be the best possible mental
fare for the odd moment? That is
what The Mentor does. In the course of
a year a reader of The Mentor gets the
substance of the contents of many books.
And it takes <i>only a few minutes</i> to read
a single number of The Mentor.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In Franz Liszt the lamp of genius burned brightly, and it
lighted many halls in the Temple of Music. He was the most
versatile of great musicians. He was the supreme pianoforte
virtuoso. He was a conductor and champion of Wagner’s
“music of the future,” teacher of great pianists, writer on
music and musicians, and a composer of pianoforte pieces, songs, symphonic
orchestral pieces, cantatas, masses, psalms, and oratorios.</p>

<p>He was born in Raiding, Hungary, October 22, 1811. At an early age,
through the financial aid of a Hungarian magnate, he began a life of
study. He first played in public at the age of eleven, and at thirteen
made a tour through Switzerland, Paris, and the French provinces. He
also went to England. At fifteen he was teaching and spending much of
his time reading the religious, political, and literary works of his time.
He was especially interested in the Saint Simonists and the romantic
mysticism of Enfantin and the teachings of Abbe Lamennais. Defying
public censure, he played compositions of Beethoven and Weber, a daring
thing in those days.</p>

<p>His development as a virtuoso began in 1831, when Paganini, the
famous violinist, first went to Paris. The success of Chopin, together
with Paganini’s art, inspired him to practise. He transcribed many
pieces, with a view to getting the effect of Paganini’s violin caprices on
the piano, and perfect his own technic. He transcribed Berlioz’s “Symphonic
Fantastique,” which ultimately led to the composition of his
Symphonic Poems.</p>

<p>A few years later (1835) he met Comtesse d’Agoult, whose pen name
was Daniel Stern, a friend and would-be rival to George Sand. Their
friendship was world famous, and it exerted a great influence on the life
and art of Liszt.</p>

<p>A patent of nobility was conferred upon him by the Emperor of
Austria, and a sword of honor, from the magnates of Hungary, was
presented to him in the name of the nation in 1840.</p>

<p>He then made a concert tour of all the leading cities in Europe, and
made a great deal of money, much of which he gave to charity. In 1845
he completed the Beethoven Statue at Bonn, at his own expense, as the
funds for this memorial had been accumulating very slowly.</p>

<p>Immediately following this period he began an active writing career,
during which he wrote articles of permanent value on the early operas
of Wagner and the work of Berlioz. He was one of the earliest supporters
of Wagner, and remained loyal to him through life. He wanted to found
a school of composers as well as pianists, and started a movement at
Weimar which resulted in a private production of Wagner’s “Lohengrin”
and “Tannhäuser,” as well as many pieces of Schumann, Weber, Schubert,
Berlioz, and others.</p>

<p>Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein was collaborating with him at this time
on many works. She was desirous of marrying the musician, who did not
care to be joined to her, and to escape the match he retired to Rome,
where he was ordained in 1865 by Cardinal Hohenlohe, and joined the
Franciscan order. He received pupils gratis, and taught for several
months of each year at the Hungarian Conservatory, Budapest. The last
ten years of his life were spent at Bayreuth, where he died July 31, 1886.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The life of Felix Mendelssohn strikes one because of its remarkable
activity, begun at a very early age. The son of a
wealthy banker, he was born at Hamburg on February 3,
1809. As the French occupied Hamburg in 1811, it was
necessary for the Mendelssohn family to move to Berlin,
where Felix received his first training from his mother.</p>

<p>At the age of eleven Felix was composing with extraordinary rapidity,
producing sixty pieces during the first year of composition, and the next
year he was writing opera.</p>

<p>The Mendelssohn family had established the custom of holding musical
festivals in the dining room of their home on alternate Sunday mornings.
The music was rendered by a small orchestra under the direction
of Felix. For each of these festivals the boy had some new composition.
Thus, at the festival on his fifteenth birthday a private performance of
his first three-act opera was held.</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen his father took him to Paris, where he met Rossini
and Meyerbeer and other well known composers. With these men he
worked and discoursed on music as if he were their equal in experience.</p>

<p>When only a little over seventeen he completed “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” which made an immediate success. During 1829 the
composer made his first of ten trips to England, where “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream” was produced. On this occasion the director of the performance
left the entire score in a coach on his return from the theater;
but Mendelssohn wrote another from memory without a single error.</p>

<p>The next few years were full of activity. Mendelssohn produced
many compositions, and filled the position of director of music, first at
Düsseldorf, then at the Gewandhaus, Leipsic. The latter position was
the highest honor in the German music world.</p>

<p>In 1837 he was married to Cécile Charlotte Sophie Jeanrenaud, whom
he took on his concert tours, and it was during a tour in England with
her that he received a call to Berlin from the king of Prussia. He left
Berlin with the title of Kapellmeister.</p>

<p>The worry of his Berlin duties, a number of which he frankly told the
king he could not fill, on account of the work at the Gewandhaus, began
to wear on his health. Despite his weakened condition, he continued to
do things. In 1843 he opened a college of music. Three years later he
introduced Jenny Lind at the Gewandhaus, and then made a tour with
her in England.</p>

<p>His activity was telling on his failing health, and when he reached
Frankfort in 1847, returning from England, the news of his sister Fanny’s
death caused him to collapse in the street. Five weeks later he had
sufficiently recovered to take a trip with his family to Interlaken, where
he remained until September, when he returned to Leipsic and lived in
privacy.</p>

<p>On October 9 he asked Madam Frege to sing his latest songs. She
left the room to get some lights, and on her return found him insensible.
He lingered until November 4, when he died in the presence of his wife,
his brother Paul, and three friends. A cross marks the site of his grave
in Berlin.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Of all the great masters of music, Franz Schubert had the least
instruction of any. His life was full of the gloom and sorrow
that surrounded so many of the earlier composers.</p>

<p>He was born in Vienna, January 31, 1797, one of a family
of fourteen, nine of whom died in infancy. His first music
lessons were given by his father on the violin and by his brother on the
pianoforte. In 1808 he was sent to preparatory school; but could not
stay after 1813, as he had failed in examinations. Although the Emperor
of Austria offered him a scholarship, he refused it.</p>

<p>He began composing at the age of sixteen, and at twenty-five had
written over 600 pieces. He had much difficulty with the publication
of his works; but finally succeeded in making a commission arrangement
with a publishing house.</p>

<p>Just how he lived from 1813 to 1818 no one knows. His music was
not published until after that time, and he never appeared in public. It
was not until the middle of 1818 that he was engaged as teacher for the
family of Johann Esterházy. He called on Beethoven with some songs
that he had dedicated to that great master. Beethoven was so deaf that
all conversation had to be carried on by pencil and paper. Schubert was
so bashful that Beethoven’s first remark about some of the variations
caused him to lose his head. He rushed from the house in terror. This
was in 1822.</p>

<p>The next two years were full of disappointment; for he met with
failure at the first production of “Alfonso and Estrella.” This broke down
his health. He left Vienna with the Esterházys for six months, and
returned in somewhat better health.</p>

<p>By 1826 there was some demand for his songs, but an almost total
ignoring of his larger works. His application for Kapellmeister was
rejected, and also that for director in the Haftheater. Just before Beethoven’s
death he paid a second visit, and found the great master favorably
inclined toward his work. Three weeks later he was pallbearer at
Beethoven’s funeral.</p>

<p>March 26, 1828, was the date of his first public concert of his own compositions.
This netted him one hundred and sixty dollars. In the fall
of the same year he fell ill, and died November 19. He was buried in
Währing, “three places higher up than Beethoven.” A marble tomb
with a bust of the composer placed between two columns marks his grave.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Although Schumann had begun to take a hand at composition
before he was seven years old, he did not begin a real
study of music until he was twenty. He was born at Zwickau,
June 8, 1810, and lived there until 1826, when he began the
study of law at the University of Leipsic. He wrote verse
when at the university, and read more poetry and literature than law.
In 1830, he took up the study of music under two masters. Herr Wieck
was his teacher of pianoforte, and Heinrich Donn of composition.</p>

<p>Although he had already composed a great deal, it was not until after
1840 that he studied harmony. Friends calling on him and his wife one
evening said that they found the master and his wife “studying Cherubini’s
counterpoint for the first time.”</p>

<p>His opportunity to become a virtuoso was lost when he lamed the
fourth finger of his right hand while trying a stunt in practising. Schumann
believed that he could train himself to reach beyond an octave by
the use of his fourth finger, and it was in an attempt to do this that he
disabled his hand.</p>

<p>With his pianoforte master Wieck, he founded a music journal, which
he edited alone from 1835 to 1844. He attempted concerts in Vienna in
1838; but failed and returned to Leipsic. In 1840 he received the degree
of Ph. D. from the University of Jena. He married Clara Wieck in the
same year; although her father objected strongly to the match. His
wife, under the name of Clara Schumann, became one of the most famous
pianists and teachers in Europe. So the musician’s fame went to his
wife; while Schumann made fame for himself as a composer. He became
teacher of score reading in the college that Mendelssohn founded at
Leipsic in 1843, and in 1847 conducted the Liedertafel. In 1850 he succeeded
Ferdinand Hiller as general music director of Düsseldorf.</p>

<p>Owing to insanity, which threatened him as early as 1833, he had to
resign in 1853, and in 1854 he jumped into the Rhine. He was committed
to an asylum at Endenish, where he died July 29, 1856. He was buried
in Bonn. A simple headstone marks his grave.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Imagine a delicate man of extreme refinement of mien and
manner, sitting at the piano and playing with no sway of
body and scarcely any movement of the arms, depending
entirely upon his narrow, feminine hands and slender fingers!”</p>

<p>This is the picture of Chopin as seen by an amateur pupil.
This great pianist, the inspiration of Liszt and the expounder of Polish
dance music and national songs, was born at Zela Zowa Wola, near
Warsaw, March 1, 1809. He was supported at college at Warsaw by an
annuity of one hundred and twenty dollars, the gift of Prince Antoine
Radziwill, who had written music for Goethe’s “Faust.”</p>

<p>The friendship of the prince is what brought Chopin into the circle of
the most graceful and refined society of the early nineteenth century,
that of Poland.</p>

<p>At nineteen Chopin made his début as a pianist in Vienna. Robert
Schumann heard him play his first piece, “Don Giovanni Fantasie,”
which led him to remark that the pianist was “the boldest and proudest
spirit of the times.” Just after this same concert the leading German
musical journal said, “M. Chopin has placed himself in the first rank of
pianists,” and praised “his delicacy of touch, his rare mechanical dexterity,
and the splendid clearness of his phrasing.”</p>

<p>In 1831 he stopped at Paris when on his way for an intended tour in
England. He stayed there and made that city his permanent home. It
was at this time that he met Madame Dudevant, better known by her
literary pseudonym, George Sand, who was destined to have a great
influence on his life.</p>

<p>Six years later, in failing health, he went to Majorca, where he recovered
for a time, due to the constant attention and tender care of
George Sand. However, in 1840 the pulmonary disease attacked him
again, and the last years of his life were a constant struggle against ill
health.</p>

<p>Chopin brought a new spirit into music, a new feeling and a new
technic into piano playing. He was regarded with admiration not unmixed
with awe. As his life drew near its end the music world watched
and worshiped him as it might a divine spirit. He died October 17, 1849.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The life of Johannes Brahms was an unsettled and wandering
one. It was not until his later years that he chose a definite
city for his home.</p>

<p>He was born in Hamburg, May 7, 1833, the son of a double-bass
player in a theater, who was his first teacher. His life
was uneventful until the age of twenty, when he began his public career
with a concert tour in company with Remenyi, the Hungarian violinist.</p>

<p>Joachim, the famous student of Mendelssohn, attended the concert
at Göttingen, where Brahms was to play the “Kreutzer” sonata of
Beethoven. The piano turned out to be a semitone below the required
pitch. Brahms played the piece from memory, transposing it from A to
B flat. Joachim discerned what the feat implied, and after the concert
introduced himself to the pianist, laying the foundation of a lifelong
friendship, through which Brahms met Liszt and Schumann. The latter,
after hearing but a few of his compositions, pronounced him “the master
of the music of the future.”</p>

<p>The Prince of Lippe-Detmold engaged him as choir director and music
master in 1854. He kept the position a few years and then resigned. He
then wandered about, giving occasional concerts at Hamburg and Zurich.
In 1863 he was appointed director of the Singakademie; but resigned
within a year.</p>

<p>He seems to have had no public activity or settled work for the next
four years, when he went on a concert tour with Joachim, and later with
Stockhausen. In 1871 he began to direct the concerts of the “Gesellschaft
der Musik-freunde,” which he continued to do until 1874. He
spent the remainder of his life in Vienna, whence he took journeys to
Italy in the spring and Switzerland in the summer.</p>

<p>He refused to go to England to take an honorary degree, Doctor of
Music, offered by Cambridge University. In 1881 the University of
Breslau conferred an honorary Ph. D. on him. Before his death he was
granted two more honors. He was created a knight of the Prussian
order, “Pour le Mérité,” in 1886, and he gained the freedom of his town
in 1889. He died at Vienna, April 3, 1897.</p>
